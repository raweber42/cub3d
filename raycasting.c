A first few variables are declared: posX and posY represent the position vector of the player, 
dirX and dirY represent the direction of the player, 
and planeX and planeY the camera plane of the player. 
Make sure the camera plane is perpendicular to the direction, but you can change the length of it. 
The ratio between the length of the direction and the camera plane determinates the FOV, here the direction vector is a bit longer than the camera plane, 
so the FOV will be smaller than 90° (more precisely, the FOV is 2 * atan(0.66/1.0)=66°, which is perfect for a first person shooter game). 
Later on when rotating around with the input keys, the values of dir and plane will be changed, but they'll always remain perpendicular and keep the same length.
